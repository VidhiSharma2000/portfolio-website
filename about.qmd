## What I Do

I translate data into stories — ones that drive decisions, boost efficiency, and uncover opportunity. Whether it's cleaning messy datasets, analyzing trends, or building dashboards that even your least tech-savvy manager can navigate, I focus on **making insights accessible**.

My toolkit includes Python, SQL, Tableau, Power BI, and cloud tools like AWS and Azure. But what sets me apart is my ability to blend **technical depth** with **business clarity** — turning complex models into solutions that actually work in the real world.
