# About Me

::: {.content-block}
I'm Vidhi A. Sharma, a Master's student in <span class="highlight">Applied Business Analytics</span> at Boston University with a background in computer science and hands-on experience in analytics, operations, and business strategy. I enjoy streamlining processes, designing data solutions, and making sense of complex problems with a mix of logic, clarity, and curiosity.

From automating reports and building dashboards to analyzing trends and improving workflows, I bring both structure and energy to the table. I'm comfortable translating between technical teams and business stakeholders, and I take pride in making things work better and look easier than they are.
